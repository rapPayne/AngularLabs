# Custom Directives

## Demonstrates two custom directives

`example here` structural directive
Need to think of a good example still.

`highlighthover` attribute directive
When the user's mouse hovers over anything with the attribute, it highlights by increasing size and applying a background color.

`rotatable` attribute directive
Allows the user to drag their mouse and rotate the object in 3D (well, not really but it kind of looks like it.)

`tableize` attribute directive
Takes in an array of objects and puts them in a `<table>` with rows and columns.


## Features
