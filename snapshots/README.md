# Labs Solutions
You've discovered the lab solutions. We're not broadcasting that these are here because of the strong temptation for people to rely too heavily on looking up the answers. It's just human nature. But it is way better for us to struggle a bit.

We **strongly** encourage you to wrestle with the exercises and try things out before looking up the answers in this section.

## To run a solution
Each lab can be run without copying any files. Just open a bash shell, cd to the lab solution folder and type in 
```
npm install
npm start
```
If you want to use a solution from a prior lab as a starter, either copy the whole folder to a new one or simply begin editing the code in that folder.
